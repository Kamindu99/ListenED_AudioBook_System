A Voice Controlled Audiobook Platform for Visually Impaired Students in Sri Lanka

The main objective of the proposed voice-controlled audio book system is to provide visually impaired
university students in Sri Lanka with access to educational materials, such as audio books, in a
convenient and user-friendly format. This will help overcome the barriers these students face in
accessing traditional learning materials and provide them with the tools they need to complete their
higher studies. The ultimate goal is to support the educational development of visually impaired
university students in Sri Lanka and provide them with equal opportunities for learning and
academic success.

## Features
- Voice Controlled System

- Colour Based User Interface Component 

- Voice Recognition Authentication Component

- Audio Book Recommendation System

## Technologies Used

The ListenED_AudioBook_System project utilizes a range of technologies to provide a voice-controlled audiobook platform for visually impaired students. These technologies include:

- **Speech Recognition**: We use state-of-the-art speech recognition technology to enable users to interact with the system through voice commands.

- **Audio Processing**: Our system leverages audio processing libraries and tools to convert text content into high-quality audio for playback.

- **Web Development**: The platform is built using web development technologies, including ReactJS, CSS, and JavaScript, to ensure accessibility and user-friendliness.

- **Backend Development**: Our backend is powered by server-side technologies like Django, Python, and postgras databases to handle user data and content management.

- **Cloud Services**: We make use of cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud for scalability and reliable cloud hosting.

- **Version Control**: We use version control systems such as Git to manage code collaboration and maintain a history of changes.

- **Machine Learning**: Machine learning algorithms are employed to enhance the accuracy of speech recognition and user interaction.

This list is not exhaustive, and the project may incorporate other technologies and libraries as needed to provide the best possible experience for visually impaired students.
